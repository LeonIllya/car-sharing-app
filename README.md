## üåü Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was to combine many components into a single, 
well-functioning system. This included ensuring that all technologies, 
such as the Telegram API and Stripe API, worked together smoothly. 
Realizing this goal required detailed planning, multiple testing iterations,
and a thoughtful approach. Thanks to my systematic approach and professional 
skills, I was able to successfully overcome these challenges and create 
a reliable and functional platform.

## üåü Possible improvements

process and improve navigation for better usability.

models and schedule pick-up/drop-off times with precision.
- Real-Time Tracking: Enable GPS tracking for rented vehicles to improve 
transparency and enhance safety.
- Flexible Payment Options: Integrate multiple payment gateways, including
Stripe API, for secure and diverse payment methods.
- Telegram Notifications: Leverage Telegram API to send real-time updates 
about booking status, reminders, and promotional offers.
- Subscription Plans: Offer subscription-based rentals for frequent 
users to reduce costs and simplify the process.
- Eco-Friendly Options: Expand the fleet to include electric and hybrid 
cars for environmentally conscious customers.
- Community Features: Add user reviews and ratings for cars to build trust
and assist new customers in making informed decisions.
